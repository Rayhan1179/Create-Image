# Create-Image
We have created this web app to make Mathematical Images for our Institution named World School of Education. Special Thanks to KaTeX(https://katex.org/) and Html2Canvas(https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) . In fact, without using these two javascript library , we couldnot complete this project properly.
As it is an open source project,you can use this web app freely.Moreove, you are invited to contribute in this project.
